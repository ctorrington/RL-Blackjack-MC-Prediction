# RL-Blackjack-MC-Prediction
Monte Carlo Value prediction for a simple deterministic policy.


This is a simplified version of Blackjack. The player can only hit or stick.
Because of this, the player does not have a decsion to make with a hand value
less than 12, because it is impossible to lose - they should just hit.
